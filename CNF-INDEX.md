Indexes (IDs) registry
============================================

For an integration with StoneWork, it is **required** that each CNF has a unique
identifier. It is recommended for the index to be assigned statically, so
that the assignment is deterministic and remains the same between deployment
restarts. 

The following table contains indexes reserved by organizations.
You can reserve your own range by creating a pull request.


| Organization            | Index range  |
